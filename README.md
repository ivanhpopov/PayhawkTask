# PayhawkTask
Repo for the task I received
The programming task was built in four stages:

- First, I created the GUI for the simple App.

- Second, I created the API call to VirusTotal and JS response parser.

- Third, I created the logic for the filtering of IPs from a file (this was not perfectly implemented)

- Fourth, I connected the files by importing the needed functions.
