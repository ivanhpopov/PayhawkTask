# PayhawkTask
Repo for the task I received

The programming task was built in four stages:

- First, I created the GUI for the simple App. (gui.py - this is the main file)

- Second, I created the API call to VirusTotal and JS response parser. (API.py)

- Third, I created the logic for the filtering of IPs from a file (this was not perfectly implemented - RegexMatch.py)

- Fourth, I connected the files by importing the needed functions.

NOTE: I have purposefully removed my API key after pushing the project to github.
